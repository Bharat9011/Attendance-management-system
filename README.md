# Attendance Management System

Hey üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è My Name is Bharat Chaudhari from Nagpur Maharashtra,Bharat(India). I make this project For education system for getting the student Attendance.

Some time for the busy schedule of a teacher some time forgot the taking the Attendance sheet that why i as a student of computer science. I identify this problem and now i want to digitalize the process of Attendance taking system

In traditional, Attendance system on regular basis only subject teacher can see the Attendance of student if the HOD and Management of college can see the Attendance they contect the subject teacher this process can get the long time
